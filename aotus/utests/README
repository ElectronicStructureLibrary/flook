Put testing programs in this subdirectory.
Ideally there should be at least one program per source module here,
which provides various tests for the implemented functionalities.

Name the source files in the form "*_test.f90", the wscript will
compile one executable out of each such source with the name
"build/utests/*_test".
To compile the test executables run:
./waf test

All the modules from the usual build environment are available in
the test programs, and dependencies will be resolved automatically
as usual.
